# HISTEX
## Introduction
The groundbreaking development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables researchers to map gene expression across tissues with spatial precision. However, current next-generation sequencing methods, which theoretically cover the entire transcriptome, face limitations in resolving spatial gene expression at high resolution. The recently introduced Visium HD technology offers a balance between sequencing depth and spatial resolution, but its complex sample preparation and high cost limit its widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we introduce HISTEX, a multimodal fusion approach that leverages a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism and a general-purpose foundation model. HISTEX integrates spot-based ST data with histology images to predict super-resolution (SR) spatial gene expression. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HISTEX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurately predicting SR gene expression across diverse datasets from multiple platforms. Moreover, experimental validation underscores HISTEXâ€™s potential to generate new biological insights. It enhances spatial patterns, enriches biologically significant pathways, and facilitates the SR annotation of tissue structures. These findings highlight HISTEX as a powerful tool for advancing ST research.
